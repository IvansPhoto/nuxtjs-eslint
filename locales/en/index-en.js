	DescriptionIndex: 'Hemoflex® is nanofibrous chitosan hemostatic gauze.',
	TopHemAgent: 'Topical hemostatic gauze',
	HemoDescr:
		' is a hemostatic gauze to be used in the first urgent aid for temporary control of external arterial, venous or capillary bleeding. Its main active component is chitosan, a biopolymer with hemostatic properties, antibacterial action, biocompatibility, and biodegradation capability.',
	Relevance: 'Relevance',
	RelevanceText:
		'Bleeding and blood loss are of the main reasons of people death in man-made and natural disasters, accidents and military conflicts. Therefore, one of the most vital issues of the modern urgent medicine especially when large veins or arteries are injured, as well as reliable hemostasis during transportation of the casualty to a medical care unit',
	Solution: 'Solution',
	SolutionText1:
		'Local hemostatic agents are used as a first urgent medical aid to control bleeding of various intensity both in Russia and abroad. The most widely used external bleeding temporary control products are those based on N-acetyl-1,4-β-D-glucosamine biopolymer, better known as chitosan',
	SolutionText2:
		'The hemostatic capabilities of chitosan were first mentioned in 1983 when it was shown that contact of the biopolymer with defibrinated/heparinized blood / red blood cells leads to formation of a gel-like blood clot 5. It encouraged use of this biopolymer for manufacturing of the medical hemostatic products.',
