	Step3Text:
		'After Hemoflex® is packed into the wound, apply manual pressure on the injured area for a short time for better contact of Hemoflex with the source of bleeding. Manual compression for 2 to 3 minutes would considerably accelerate bleeding control process. Evaluate bleeding control visually. Bleeding may not stop if large vessels are badly damaged. This way removes Hemoflex from the wound as quick as possible and use a new one. If repeated use of Hemoflex appears ineffective, use a tourniquet.',
	Step4:
